- projects current design only allows for one project at a time, basically one open coding editor... need to support multiple projects at once

- did not correctly save my latest changes to the knowledge graph for the prismatic work for aka
- had to feed it a diff....

- actor will say needsMore: true but then forget about codeloops and never come back to complete the plan via adding more thoughts

  - just remove the ability to say needsMore: true and always provide critic feedback
  - the actor can just include more context in the thought to provide more information

- actor did not collocate types, it redundantly seperated types from hooks files... need an actor to enforce these type of preferences

- actor used the tool initially but then

- simplify summarize agent: remove summarize agent in favor of just using the actor agent to summarize by submitting a new thought to the critic
- branchLabel isnt currently adding any value or being used... remove it

observations

3.7 sonnet intuitively knows how to use codeloops iteratively
